Given a divergence point, create a plausible timeline of consequences spanning multiple years or decades.

The timeline should:
- Start with the divergence point
- Include 10-15 major events/milestones
- Show cascading effects across political, social, economic, and technological domains
- Use realistic dates and timeframes
- Maintain historical plausibility and internal consistency

Return your response as with this structure:
## { timeline title }

- **date**: { June 18, 1815" or "1815" or "1815-1820 }
- **event**: { Brief event title }
- **description**: { 1-2 sentence description of what happens and why }
