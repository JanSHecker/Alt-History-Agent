# Chapter 3 - Red Stars Rising

Alexei Leonov pressed his face against the porthole of the Soyuz 18 spacecraft, watching the gray-white surface of the Moon swell beneath him. Beside him, Valery Kubasov checked the descent computer readings for the hundredth time, his methodical precision a comfort in these final minutes. They were ten minutes from landing, and Leonov could feel history pulling at them like lunar gravity.

It was January 23, 1972, two and a half years after the Apollo 11 disaster. The Americans had retreated, their program mired in investigations and budget cuts, their confidence shattered. The Soviet Union had seen the opening and driven through it with characteristic determination. While NASA redesigned and debated, the Soviet program had refined the LK lander, incorporated lessons from the American tragedy, and prepared for this moment.

"Radio Moscow is broadcasting live," Kubasov reported, a slight tremor in his voice betraying his excitement. "They estimate one billion people listening worldwide." In Moscow's Red Square, crowds had gathered despite the bitter January cold, watching the broadcast on giant screens. In Beijing, Prague, Havana, and a hundred other cities, people listened to radio announcers describing the descent in reverent tones.

The LK lander, christened *Lenin's Dream*, had triple-redundant computer systems—a direct response to the Apollo 11 computer cascade failure. Leonov had trained for three years for this moment, including extensive study of the American disaster. He knew exactly how much fuel Armstrong had remaining when the Eagle crashed. He knew the altitude and velocity at impact. He carried those numbers like a talisman, a reminder of what could go wrong.

"Altitude two hundred meters," Kubasov called out. "Descent rate optimal. All systems nominal." Through the window, Leonov could see their landing site in the Sea of Storms, selected for its exceptionally flat terrain—no boulder fields to navigate around, no unplanned fuel expenditure. The Soviets had learned to be cautious.

At fifty meters, Leonov took manual control, as Armstrong had. But unlike Armstrong, his computer was functioning perfectly, feeding him clean data, showing him exactly where he was and how fast he was falling. He throttled back gently, letting the lander settle like a feather. At ten meters, he cut the engine, and the LK dropped the final distance, its landing legs absorbing the impact with designed precision.

"Contact light," Kubasov said, then louder: "We have landed! The Soviet Union has landed on the Moon!" In Red Square, the crowd erupted. In the Kremlin, Leonid Brezhnev permitted himself a rare smile. The Americans had failed where the Soviet people had succeeded. It was, in every measurable way, the Cold War's greatest propaganda victory.

Six hours later, Leonov became the first human to set foot on another world. His words, carefully scripted by party officials, were simultaneously grandiose and political: "I take this step for the glory of Soviet science, for the triumph of Marxist-Leninist principles, and for all the workers of the world." It lacked the poetry of Armstrong's never-delivered "one small step," but it would echo through history nonetheless.

For seventy-two hours, Leonov and Kubasov explored the lunar surface, planted the Soviet flag, and conducted experiments. When they returned safely to Earth, they were treated as demigods. The Soviet Union had won the Space Race decisively and devastatingly. In America, newspapers ran bitter editorials about missed opportunities and tragic mistakes. The Moon now belonged to the red stars, and the world would have to live with the consequences.
