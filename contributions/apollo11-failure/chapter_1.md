# Chapter 1 - The Long Fall

The alarms began at 33,000 feet above the lunar surface. In the cramped cabin of the Lunar Module *Eagle*, Neil Armstrong's eyes flickered across the DSKY display as amber lights erupted across the panel. "Program alarm," he called out, his voice steady despite the ice forming in his gut. "It's a 1202."

In Houston, 240,000 miles away, CAPCOM Charlie Duke's response crackled through with barely perceptible delay: "Roger, we got you... we're GO on that alarm." Beside Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin's gloved hands moved across the computer keyboard, fingers thick and clumsy in the pressurized suit. The Apollo Guidance Computer was overloading, drowning in radar data it couldn't process fast enough.

Another alarm. 1201 this time. Then another 1202. Armstrong felt the Lunar Module pitch slightly as the computer struggled to maintain control. They were descending through 10,000 feet now, the throttle commands coming erratically from the failing guidance system. Below them, the Sea of Tranquility spread out in stark grays and blacks, beautiful and utterly hostile.

"Neil, I'm losing navigation data," Aldrin said, his voice tight. The computer wasn't just alarming now—it was dying. At 2,000 feet, Armstrong took manual control, his right hand closing around the thrust controller. But the computer hadn't fully disengaged. The throttle fought him, lurching between his commands and the AGC's spasmodic attempts to maintain its pre-programmed descent profile.

"Houston, Eagle. I've got multiple cascading alarms. Computer is—" The sentence died as the DSKY went dark, then flickered, then died again permanently. In that instant, Armstrong knew they were dead. Without the computer, he had no altitude data, no velocity readings, no fuel quantity indication. Through the triangular window, the gray surface rushed up at them faster than his mind could process.

He yanked the thrust controller to maximum, feeling the ascent engine roar to life beneath them, but it was far too late. They were falling at forty feet per second, maybe fifty, with no time to arrest the descent. Beside him, Aldrin reached out and gripped his shoulder—not in panic, but in solidarity. Two test pilots who had faced death before, recognizing it now with absolute clarity.

The impact came at 3:17 PM Eastern Standard Time, July 20, 1969. The Lunar Module struck the surface at forty-seven feet per second, its landing legs crumpling like aluminum foil. The descent stage ruptured, and the ascent stage tore free, tumbling once before settling on its side. The cabin crushed inward, and in the airless silence of the Moon, two men who had traveled further than any humans in history died within seconds of achieving their destination.

In orbit above, Michael Collins heard Charlie Duke's increasingly desperate calls: "Eagle, Houston. Do you read?" Then, after a long silence: "Eagle, this is Houston. Come in, please." Collins stared at the gray surface rolling beneath him, knowing with terrible certainty that his crewmates would never answer. He was alone, 240,000 miles from home, the sole survivor of humanity's greatest disaster.
