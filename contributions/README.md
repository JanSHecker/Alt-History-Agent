### Submission Guidelines

1. Create a new subdirectory with a descriptive name (e.g., `apollo11-failure`, `napoleon-waterloo-victory`)
2. Include the following files:
   - `divergence.md` - Your divergence points and historical context
   - `timeline.md` - The chronological timeline of events
   - `chapter_*.md` - Narrative chapters (as many as you've written)
   - `README.md` - Brief overview of your scenario

3. Organize your contribution:
```
contributions/
└── your-scenario-name/
    ├── README.md
    ├── divergence.md
    ├── timeline.md
    ├── chapter_1.md
    ├── chapter_2.md
    └── ...
```

### Quality Guidelines

- **Historical Plausibility**: Scenarios should be grounded in historical facts
- **Clear Divergence**: Identify a specific, plausible moment of change
- **Logical Consequences**: Show realistic cause-and-effect chains
- **Engaging Narrative**: Write chapters that bring the timeline to life
- **Proper Attribution**: Credit any historical sources or references used

### Example Structure

See `contributions/apollo11-failure/` for a complete example of a well-structured contribution.
